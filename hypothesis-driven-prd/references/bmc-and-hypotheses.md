# Business Model Canvas Deep Dive

Reference for thorough BMC exploration. Use when user selects "Thorough" discovery mode.

## Block-by-Block Question Bank

### Value Proposition

**Core questions:**
1. What job is the customer trying to get done?
2. What pain are we eliminating? (frustrations, obstacles, risks)
3. What gain are we creating? (benefits, desires, aspirations)

**Deeper probes:**
- If this didn't exist, what would customers do instead?
- What makes existing solutions inadequate?
- Is this a painkiller (must-have) or vitamin (nice-to-have)?
- What's the "wow moment" when someone first uses this?

**Red flags to challenge:**
- "Everyone needs this" → Push for specific segment
- "It's better" → Better how? Measurable?
- "No competition" → What do people do today?

### Customer Segments

**Core questions:**
1. Who has this problem most acutely?
2. Who would pay the most / soonest for a solution?
3. Who is easiest to reach?

**Deeper probes:**
- What characterizes your ideal first 10 customers?
- Who should we explicitly NOT target (yet)?
- What's the customer's current awareness of the problem?
- Are buyers and users the same person?

**Segmentation dimensions:**
- Demographics (age, income, location)
- Psychographics (values, attitudes, lifestyle)
- Behavioral (usage patterns, purchase history)
- Needs-based (what job they're hiring for)

### Channels

**Core questions:**
1. How will customers discover us?
2. How will they evaluate us?
3. How will they purchase?
4. How will they receive value?
5. How will we provide support?

**Channel types:**
- **Owned:** Website, app, sales team, physical stores
- **Partner:** Resellers, affiliates, marketplaces
- **Earned:** Word of mouth, PR, organic search
- **Paid:** Advertising, sponsorships

**Deeper probes:**
- Where does the target customer already spend attention?
- What's the CAC assumption for primary channel?
- Which channel has lowest friction to first value?

### Customer Relationships

**Core questions:**
1. What type of relationship does each segment expect?
2. How do we establish, maintain, and grow relationships?
3. What drives retention vs. churn?

**Relationship types:**
- **Personal assistance:** Dedicated human support
- **Self-service:** Customer serves themselves
- **Automated:** Personalized automation
- **Communities:** User-to-user connections
- **Co-creation:** Customer participates in value creation

**Deeper probes:**
- What would make a customer tell a friend?
- What would make a customer leave?
- How sticky is the product once adopted?

### Revenue Streams

**Core questions:**
1. What are customers really willing to pay for?
2. How much? How do we know?
3. What pricing model fits the value delivery?

**Pricing models:**
- Asset sale (one-time purchase)
- Usage fee (per use/unit)
- Subscription (recurring access)
- Licensing (permission to use)
- Freemium (free tier + paid upgrade)
- Marketplace (transaction fee)

**Deeper probes:**
- What's the willingness-to-pay evidence?
- What's the LTV assumption? Payback period?
- Is pricing aligned with value creation moments?

### Key Resources

**Core questions:**
1. What resources are essential to deliver the value proposition?
2. What resources are hardest to replicate?

**Resource types:**
- **Physical:** Facilities, equipment, inventory
- **Intellectual:** IP, brand, proprietary data
- **Human:** Expertise, relationships
- **Financial:** Cash, credit, equity

### Key Activities

**Core questions:**
1. What activities are essential to deliver value?
2. What must we do exceptionally well?

**Activity types:**
- **Production:** Design, make, deliver
- **Problem-solving:** Consulting, diagnosis, custom solutions
- **Platform/network:** Building and maintaining platform

### Key Partners

**Core questions:**
1. Who are essential partners?
2. What do we acquire from them vs. do ourselves?

**Partnership types:**
- Strategic alliances (non-competitors)
- Coopetition (competitors collaborating)
- Joint ventures
- Buyer-supplier relationships

### Cost Structure

**Core questions:**
1. What are the most important costs?
2. Which key resources/activities are most expensive?
3. Is the model cost-driven or value-driven?

**Cost types:**
- Fixed vs. variable
- Economies of scale
- Economies of scope

# Hypothesis Patterns

## Acquisition Hypothesis Patterns

**Pattern: Channel effectiveness**
> If we [use channel X],  
> then [Y% of target segment will discover us],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [CAC < $Z, conversion rate > W%]

**Pattern: Message resonance**
> If we position as [value prop framing],  
> then [target segment will prefer us over alternatives],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [click-through > X%, demo requests > Y/month]

**Pattern: Viral/referral**
> If we [enable sharing mechanism],  
> then [existing users will refer new users],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [viral coefficient > 1, referral rate > X%]

## Activation Hypothesis Patterns

**Pattern: Onboarding**
> If we [simplify first experience to X steps],  
> then [new users will reach "aha moment"],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [X% complete onboarding in Y minutes]

**Pattern: Time-to-value**
> If we [enable quick win via feature X],  
> then [users will experience core value on day 1],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [X% complete key action in first session]

## Retention Hypothesis Patterns

**Pattern: Habit formation**
> If we [create trigger/routine via X],  
> then [users will return at frequency Y],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [DAU/MAU > X%, D7 retention > Y%]

**Pattern: Switching cost**
> If we [enable data/content investment],  
> then [users will be reluctant to switch],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [churn rate < X%, avg tenure > Y months]

## Revenue Hypothesis Patterns

**Pattern: Willingness to pay**
> If we [offer X at price Y],  
> then [Z% of users will convert to paid],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [conversion > X%, ARPU > $Y]

**Pattern: Expansion revenue**
> If we [offer upgrade/upsell X],  
> then [paying customers will increase spend],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [net revenue retention > 100%]

## Referral Hypothesis Patterns

**Pattern: Organic sharing**
> If we [make output shareable],  
> then [users will share with peers],  
> because [rationale].  
> Evidence: [shares per user > X, attributed signups > Y%]

# Common Pitfalls

**Hypothesis pitfalls:**
- Not falsifiable ("users will like it")
- No clear metric ("engagement will improve")
- Too many variables ("if we build A, B, and C...")
- Confirmation bias (only looking for success signals)

**BMC pitfalls:**
- Treating assumptions as facts
- Skipping customer segments (building for "everyone")
- Ignoring existing alternatives
- Underestimating channel costs

**PRD pitfalls:**
- Features without traced hypotheses
- Metrics without falsification criteria
- No prioritization or critical path
- Scope creep via "nice to have" features
